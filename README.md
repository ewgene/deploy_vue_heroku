## Getting Started

The source code used in this project can be found at https://github.com/ijklim/pingshuai.

The files in this project are produced from running the following command in the source folder.

```

This project contains files from the /dist/ folder after the build command.

Files that are NOT generated by the 'npm run build' command:
* LICENSE - github standard MIT license
* lighthouse-score.png - Screenshot for README
* README.md - The file you are reading now
* .gitignore - git version control ignore file
* .htaccess - Configuration file for use on web servers


## Installation



Note #2: The LICENSE, lighthouse-score.png, README.md and .gitignore files are not required for the Vue.js app to work. Skipping them during upload is acceptable.
